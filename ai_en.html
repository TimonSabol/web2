            <h3 style="text-align: center;">What is AI?</h3>
            <p class="te">Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of technology that is growing rapidly, changing the way we perceive and use technology in everyday life. In the future, AI has the potential to revolutionise almost every field - from medicine to industry, education or transport. However, this evolution also raises many challenges and ethical questions that will need to be addressed.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">What is AI currently capable of and used for?</h3>
            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Finance & Banking</p>
            <p class="te">In the financial sector, AI is used to:</p>
            <p class="te">Fraud detection: AI analyses transaction patterns and identifies suspicious operations. Automated investment advice (robo-advisors): AI helps users create investment strategies based on market analysis. Risk management: AI helps financial institutions assess credit risk, detect market risk, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Natural language processing (NLP)</p>
            <p class="te">The branch of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret and generate human language. Technologies such as GPT chat (i.e. conversational systems) are an example of this type of development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Deep Learning</p>
            <p class="te">A subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks to solve more complex problems such as image recognition, language translation or speech analysis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Robotics</p>
            <p class="te">AI-enabled robots are becoming increasingly sophisticated and can perform a variety of tasks, including those requiring complex reasoning and manipulation: Medical robots: Surgical robots, such as da Vinci - enable doctors to perform precise operations with minimal incisions. AI can also assist in diagnosis and treatment planning. Robots for elderly care: AI in robots supports elderly care by helping with health monitoring, medication reminders or social interaction.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">What is the future for AI?</h3>
            <p class="te">AI has the potential in the future to automate many routine and repetitive tasks across industries such as manufacturing, transportation, financial services and healthcare. For example, robots could replace humans in certain roles in factories, and autonomous cars could revolutionise transport.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="te">Advanced human-AI collaboration: Instead of replacing humans, AI can become an advanced tool to assist humans in their work. AI tools can help analyse large data sets, make real-time decisions or solve complex scientific problems, such as in genomics, chemistry or astrophysics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="te">Emotional intelligence AI: Technologies can develop the ability to understand people's emotions, so AI could better support, for example, in healthcare, education or customer interactions, offering a more personalised experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="te">Sustainability and ethics of AI: The application of AI in the context of environmental protection, sustainable development and in the fight against crises such as climate change can bring real benefits. On the other hand, understanding and implementing appropriate ethical regulations regarding privacy, justice and accountability of AI will be crucial to avoid unintended consequences.</p>
