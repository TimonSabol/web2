            <p class="te">Human health is not only about a fit body, but also about the mind. This is how HEAR SPACE, an app designed to connect people with similar health problems, was created. It uses so-called matchmaking technology - the user only has to create a profile and share his or her concerns. He or she is then matched with people he or she can talk to on the platform, as well as any articles and online resources related to the problem.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Medscape News</h3>
            <p class="te">The most popular app among doctors in the US and one of the oldest is hard to miss. It can be found in most lists of the most important medical apps for professionals. First and foremost, it is known for its medical news - events, discoveries, research and advances grouped into 34 fields/departments. But - as the Excellent WebWorld ranking reads - Medscape ‘is more than that’. - ‘is a complete dictionary for doctors’. Intech Media: ‘Medscape is so comprehensive that it is more like a medical school at your fingertips than just an app’.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Software</h3>
            <p class="te">How about swimming goggles that display your heart rate data during exercise? Attached to the Goggle FORM, polar sensors from the swimmer's temples send data to the goggles, which are then synchronised with the user's app. This makes it possible to manage workouts as well as monitor rehabilitation.</p>
