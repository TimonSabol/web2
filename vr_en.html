            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">VR</p>
            <p class="te">is a technology that creates a completely virtual environment in which the user can immerse themselves. It uses special devices, such as VR goggles, which obscure the user's field of vision and display three-dimensional, computer-generated images. The user can interact with this environment using controllers or body movements, allowing for a realistic experience, such as when playing games or even training.</p>

            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">AR</p>
            <p class="te">is a technology that superimposes digital elements (e.g. images, sounds, animations) onto the real world. AR does not replace the real environment, but augments it by combining virtual elements with the real environment. Examples include applications such as Pokémon GO, which allow users to see virtual Pokémon characters in a real-world setting through a smartphone screen. Other applications of AR include navigation, data visualisation or repair assistance.</p>

            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">VR technology in medicine</p>
            <p class="te">The first example of the use of VR technology in medicine was the award-winning brand campaign EXCEDRIN at Cannes. Specialists developed software that allowed to see how a person feels during a migraine headache attack. However, that is not all. Virtual reality also helps in therapy - a project created by the company Floreo allowed people with autism to train their brains. Studies have shown that their concentration has significantly improved, and progress in interaction with the outside world has also been recorded.</p>

            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Educational simulations</p>
            <p class="te">VR is used for learning in a variety of fields, such as medicine, engineering, aviation or the military. With VR, students can practice in a virtual environment, such as performing operations in medicine or piloting aircraft in simulators.</p>

            <p class="te" style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;">Training for employees</p>
            <p class="te">Companies are using VR for training, allowing employees to practice in safe, virtual environments, such as when learning how to operate machinery or respond to emergencies.</p>
